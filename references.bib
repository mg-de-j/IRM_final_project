	abstract = {Existing research indicates that machine translations (MTs) of literary texts are often unsatisfactory. MTs are typically evaluated using automated metrics and subjective human ratings, with limited focus on stylistic features. Evidence is also limited on whether state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) will reshape literary translation. This study examines the stylistic features of LLM translations, comparing GPT-4's performance to human translations in a Chinese online literature task. Computational stylometry analysis shows that GPT-4 translations closely align with human translations in lexical, syntactic, and content features, suggesting that LLMs might replicate the 'human touch' in literary translation style. These findings offer insights into AI's impact on literary translation from a posthuman perspective, where distinctions between machine and human translations become increasingly blurry.},

	abstract = {This study presents the first systematic empirical comparison of neural architectures for Universal Dependencies (UD) parsing in Old English, thus addressing central questions in computational historical linguistics and low-resource language processing. We evaluate three approaches—a baseline spaCy pipeline, a pipeline with a pretrained tok2vec component, and a MobileBERT transformer-based model—across datasets ranging from 1000 to 20,000 words. Our results demonstrate that the pretrained tok2vec model consistently outperforms alternatives, because it achieves 83.24\% UAS and 74.23\% LAS with the largest dataset, whereas the transformer-based approach substantially underperforms despite higher computational costs. Performance analysis reveals that basic tagging tasks reach 85–90\% accuracy, while dependency parsing achieves approximately 75\% accuracy. We identify critical scaling thresholds, with substantial improvements occurring between 1000 and 5000 words and diminishing returns beyond 10,000 words, which provides insights into scaling laws for historical languages. Technical analysis reveals that the poor performance of the transformer stems from parameter-to-data ratio mismatches (1250:1) and the unique orthographic and morphological characteristics of Old English. These findings defy assumptions about transformer superiority in low-resource scenarios and establish evidence-based guidelines for researchers working with historical languages. The broader significance of this study extends to enabling an automated analysis of three million words of extant Old English texts and providing a framework for optimal architecture selection in data-constrained environments. Our results suggest that medium-complexity architectures with monolingual pretraining offer superior cost–benefit trade-offs compared to complex transformer models for historical language processing.},

	abstract = {[Optional OV order in Later Middle English (LME) has given rise to conflicting theoretical accounts. Earlier analyses postulating movement to AgrOP or alternative base orders are found to be inadequate to deal with the occurrence of OV in non-literary LME; in a large database of 15th century private familial correspondence, residual OV order is found to have been productive only with negated objects. Multiple subject constructions with there expletives showed the same restriction. These phenomena are accounted for by postulating overt Neg Movement (Haegeman 1995) as a permitted option in LME. In this framework, it is argued that LME showed a mixed typology having both Neg movement and a null Neg operator. LME had three ways of satisfying the NEG Criterion (Haegeman 1995): Merge not in Spec NegP, coindex \$[\{{\textbackslash}rm OP\}]\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm i\}\}{\textbackslash}ldots [\{{\textbackslash}rm XP\}(\{{\textbackslash}rm Neg\})]\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm i\}\}\$, and Move XP(Neg) to Spec NegP. Modern English has only the first two. The distribution in this period of negative concord with not is shown to support our analysis.]},
