# Analysis of word order and case variation in Beowulf translations

## General information
This project investigates the evolution of English syntax by looking at *Beowulf* translations. Specifically, it quantifies how translation practices have shifted regarding sentence structure and the preservation of historical linguistic features. The study aims to determine if modern translations have discarded archaic sentence structures (non-SVO) to appeal to modern readers, potentially altering the "text" and historical preservation.

## Research question & Hypotheses

**Research question:**
Ho do word order and the use of cases vary between translations of *Beowulf* published pre-1900 and post-1900?

**Hypothesis:** 
Translations published pre-1900 will feature a significantly higher relative frequency of non-SVO word order and case usage compared to translations published post-1900, which are expected to follow modern English syntax more strictly.

## Method

### Dataset
The analysis focuses on verse translation of *Beowulf* to ensure comparability, as prose would differ too much
- **Pre-1900:** Morris (1895)
- **Post-1900:** Gummere (1910)

### Variables & Sampling
- **Independent Variable:** Publication Era (Pre-1900 vs. Post-1900)
- **Dependent Variable 1:** Relative frequency of word order patterns (Percentage of total clauses that are SVO vs. non-SVO)
- **Dependent Variable 2:** Relative frequency of case markings (Number of archaic case endings per 1,000 words)

# Goal: Preparing the GitHub repository for your project

As part of your final project, you also need to create a GitHub repository. In this milestone assignment, you will prepare your GitHub repository. The instructions are the following:

    Create a GitHub account and repository. If needed, familiarize yourself with GitHub using slides from Lecture 5.
    Create a project outline on your GitHub page as the .ReadMe; this outline should include the following subsections:
        General information, describing your project (i.e., the abstract)
        Background information (list at least two studies that have looked at your topic, including correct referencing)
        Research question and hypotheses (revised on the basis of our feedback and the feedback of your peers)
        Method (including the dataset in use, sampling method etc.)

In order to pass this milestone, you need to complete two tasks.

    Task 1: submit a link to your GitHub page, which should include all the details listed above.
    Task 2: present your GitHub page during the lab session 6 by uploading it here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-oRkAJ7jFjpjq7if7wX8u0f0O9vwKQLjCvwYQCMi9VU/edit?usp=sharing

Before submitting your project reports, we expect your GitHub page to be updated, including the relevant .ReadMe file and all code required for reproducibility.
