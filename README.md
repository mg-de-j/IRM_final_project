# Goal: Preparing the GitHub repository for your project

As part of your final project, you also need to create a GitHub repository. In this milestone assignment, you will prepare your GitHub repository. The instructions are the following:

    Create a GitHub account and repository. If needed, familiarize yourself with GitHub using slides from Lecture 5.
    Create a project outline on your GitHub page as the .ReadMe; this outline should include the following subsections:
        General information, describing your project (i.e., the abstract)
        Background information (list at least two studies that have looked at your topic, including correct referencing)
        Research question and hypotheses (revised on the basis of our feedback and the feedback of your peers)
        Method (including the dataset in use, sampling method etc.)

In order to pass this milestone, you need to complete two tasks.

    Task 1: submit a link to your GitHub page, which should include all the details listed above.
    Task 2: present your GitHub page during the lab session 6 by uploading it here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-oRkAJ7jFjpjq7if7wX8u0f0O9vwKQLjCvwYQCMi9VU/edit?usp=sharing

Before submitting your project reports, we expect your GitHub page to be updated, including the relevant .ReadMe file and all code required for reproducibility.
